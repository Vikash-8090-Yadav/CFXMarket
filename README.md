## Working Flow !!

- **Listing Products**: Farmers can easily list their products on our website.

- **Unique Digital Assets**: Each product is represented as a unique digital asset called an NFT (non-fungible token), ensuring it has its own digital identity that can't be replicated or divided.

- **Buy and Resell**: Anyone can buy these NFT products from the farmers, and once someone owns an NFT, they can resell it to others.

- **Product  Review**: If a farmer isn't satisfied with how a particular item is being treated or represented, they can register a case for it to maintain the integrity and reputation of their products.
